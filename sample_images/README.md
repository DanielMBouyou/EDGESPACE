# Sample images

Sample images are generated locally from TS-SatFire and are not committed to GitHub
(Kaggle dataset files must not be redistributed).

To generate a few test images locally:

```powershell
python -m uv run python scripts\export_sample_images.py
```

The images will be saved in this folder.
